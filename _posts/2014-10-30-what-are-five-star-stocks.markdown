## In this tutorial

In this tutorial we explain what are 5 star stocks at Stockflare and how to use them to be a better stock picker.

### Table of contents

We’ll divide our time into 3 parts

0. Firstly, why have we designed a 5 star rating system 
0. Secondly, what are each of the stars and how do we calculate them
0. Finally, how can you use the 5 stars to help you pick stock

### Part 1. Why 5 stars?

Now, if you are wondering what I am talking about when I say 5 stars, just look at Stockflare.com
You’ll see the stars beside every stock.

So, let’s think about the problem we all face when it comes to picking stocks.

There are so many of them. 

* Globally there are over 40,000. 
* In the US there are over 8,000 stocks, and of those 8,000, over 2,000 are multi billion dollar businesses
* So there are just too many options for anyone to look at.

Then, if we think of all the financial data you are bombarded with

* There are hundreds of financial metrics and analysis you could run.

You could quickly be overwhelmed. And if you are, you might give up and hand your money over to a professional, who’ll go on to charge you high fees despite the likelihood of he’s going to perform poorly.

So we need a starting point. And at Stockflare, we condense all the hundreds of metrics for the thousands of stocks into just 5 stars.

For us, that starting point is quite simple.

* Is the company behind the stock a good business.
* Is the stock trading at a reasonable price.
* And finally, what do people think about the stock. i.e. is sentiment positive or not.

### Part 2. Let’s look at the details of the 5 stars

For us the most critical metric is the quality of the business itself. So we give 3 out of the 5 stars for this alone.

* Firstly, we look at the profitability of the business.
* Next we check if the business is growing.
* And finally, we look at the cashflow of the business. for example is it returning cash to me as a shareholder.

#### Profitablity

So when we say profitable, what numbers are we looking at?

The most commonly used metric for stocks is the earnings per share figure. 

You make be asking, what on earth is that.

Let’s take the example of a business that makes 20 dollars of profit. Remember, a business is owned by its stockholders. i.e. that 20 dollars is your money.

Now, say there are 10 different stockholders each with 1 share. 

* Divide 20 by 10 and
* Each share of those shares owns 2 dollars of profit.
* That’s what Earnings per share is, or EPS for short. 

#### Growth

Next, let’s explore growth. How do we calculate this star?

When we look at growth, we look at

* Sales
* Profits
* Long-term forecasts

If a business isn’t doing well on all 3 numbers, it doesn’t get the growth star.

#### Dividends

For the 3rd star, we look at dividends.

Again, you may be asking yourself, what dividends are.

Let’s think back to our example of the company that made 20 dollars this year. With each share owning 2 dollars of profit. 

Well, as a shareholder, you can’t ring up the CEO and ask him to send you the 2 dollars. 

The company’s board decide for you what to do with that money. Some businesses decide to keep it. Saving for a rainy day, or investing more in the business.

And other businesses pay some of it out to the shareholders. These payments are called dividends.

Though it’s pretty rare to see all the profits paid out. So in our 2 dollars of earnings example, we could expect maybe 50 cents being lodged into our account.

#### Valuation, cheap or expensive

Next we move onto the price of the stock. 

This star is driven by a calculation on whether the price is cheap or expensive. 

So how do we calculate this star.

* Let’s take an example of 2 different stocks, both earning their shareholders 2 dollars a share. 
* That’s an EPS of 2 dollars.
* Suppose one stock’s price is 20 dollars and the other’s price is 10 dollars.
* Quite simply, the 10 dollar share is cheaper.
* You are paying half the price to get the same 2 dollars of profit

So the lower the price, for the same amount of earnings, the cheaper the stock. 

* 10 dollars divided by 2 dollars of earnings is a multiple of 5x
* and 20 by 2 is a multiple of 10x

This comparison is called the Price to Earnings ratio, or PE for short. The lower the PE ratio the cheaper the stock.

#### Sentiment

The 5th and final star, relates to sentiment. i.e. what do other people think about the stock.

At Stockflare, we focus on the views of the experts. And when we say experts, we are referring to the professionals at the leading investment banks and brokerage firms across the world.

These professionals talk to the CEOs, the competitors, the regulators, the customers, the central bankers, yes, anyone and everyone who’s got a useful insight. 

Then they make a recommendation. In fact the big asset management firms are paying big money to investment banks exactly to get their insight.

What are these recommendations? These experts publish forecasts for the companies profits, they predict where the share price is going and they even say, Buy, Sell or tell you to Hold-on to your stock. 

We use this data to check if sentiment for a stock is positive or negative.

#### The 5 stars

So there you have it! 

* 3 stars for the quality of the business
* 1 if the stocks cheap
* and the fifth star if the experts like the stock

#### Looking at an example

Let’s have a quick look at Stockflare and see all this analysis.

How about we choose Microsoft. We can see it’s a 4 star stock. 

So, on the right hand side we can see the 3 business stars. 

* It’s profitable
* It pays dividends
* Ah, but sadly, its not growing as fast as its competitors.

Then on the left,
* We can see that its cheap
* And for the views of the Experts, Wall Street thinks its worth more than today’s price & they are recommending their clients buy it.

### Part 3. Will 5 star stocks help you?

This is the most critical part of this tutorial.

Will our 5 star rating system help you pick stocks?

* Quite simply, yes!
* Why? Cutting through the hundreds of datapoints and financial metrics is key. Too often we are bombarded with so much data in finance that we can’t see the wood from the trees.
* But, our 5 stars are just a starting point.
* Remember, if you’ve no idea what the company behind the stock actually does, they would probably shouldn’t be buying it.

A 5 star rating is not a reason to buy a stock, it’s a reason to start considering it.
