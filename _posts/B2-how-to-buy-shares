The second paragraph becomes the first paragraph on the tutorial page, so that you can provide separate content.

There are three variables that need to be set for each tutorial, `ttc` (time-to-completion) and should be in the format of Xmin. The second is `difficulty` which can be either beginner, intermediate or advanced. Lastly, you need to determine which category this tutorial belongs in, currently we support `stockflare` or `investing`.
