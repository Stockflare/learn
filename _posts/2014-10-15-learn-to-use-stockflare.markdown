The first paragraph from a post will be used as the excerpt for the tutorial content. But it will not be displayed on the tutorial's page. **The category for this post is "stockflare".**

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/108550980?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

The second paragraph becomes the first paragraph on the tutorial page, so that you can provide separate content.

There are three variables that need to be set for each tutorial, `ttc` (time-to-completion) and should be in the format of Xmin. The second is `difficulty` which can be either beginner, intermediate or advanced. Lastly, you need to determine which category this tutorial belongs in, currently we support `stockflare` or `investing`.
