0. What's best for you?
 
### Part 1. Different schools of investing

There are 2 main strategies that people can follow.

* Actively managing your money yourself, with 3 sub-strategies
  * Growth investing
  * Value investing
  * Quality investing
* Passive investing, hiring someone else to manage your money for you

 #### Passive investing
 
Passive investing is almost an admission of defeat! You decide that you can't beat the market yourself, so you decide to track the market.

Defeat is a strong word. Retreat may be better.

* You are focused on reducing the fees you pay
* Investing is too much a headache or seems too complicated
* You don't wish to spend the time managing your money yourself
 
And despite this critism, passive investing is entirely sensible and practical for many people.

### Part 2. Growth investing

What defines a growth strategy? Growth investors like:

* Growth
* Momentum
* Buzz

Growth investors do not focus on:

* Valuation
* Dividends

### Part 3. Value investing

What defines a value strategy? Value investors like:

* Price
* Cashflow / Asset Values
* Ignored

Growth investors do not focus on:

* Growth
* Short-term / Buzz
 
### Part 4. Quality investing

What defines a quality strategy? Quality investors like:

* Industry Leaders
* Stable Cashflows
* Good Managers

Growth investors do not focus on:

* Growth
* Value

### Part 5. What is best for you?

Everyone has a different perspective and pyschology. Our likes and flavours differ. 

Though when asked, most people will say they are a Quality Investor, searching for quality stocks. It's what we like to tell people.

However, most people lean towards being a Growth Investor or a Value Investor. It's best not to kid yourself.

Just answer a simple question. Why do you want to be:

0. Do you want to own hot stocks and ride the trends?
0. Do you want to buy dollar bills for 80 cents? Knowing that it will require a waiting game.

1 is a growth investor. 2 is a value investor.
