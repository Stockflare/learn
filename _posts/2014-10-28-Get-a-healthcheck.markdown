0. Do I need to take action 

### Part 1. Adding your portfolio

There are there easy ways

* Within search
* On any stock page
* At the Watchlist page

#### Search

When you search for a stock, or are looking at any widget, you'll see a little eye. Click on this eye, it goes blue, and there you are. It's in your watch list.

#### At a Stock page

Let's take the example of Johnson & Johnson. You click through the the stock page. At the top of the page there is a big blue Watch button. Once clicked. It turns red.

Alternatively, you can add a specific number of shares that you own.

### At the Watchlist

At the watchlist you can untick a stock to remove it from your watchlist. 

And you can use the Projected Portfolio section to edit the number of shares in your portfolio.

### Part 2. Running a Health Check

There are 4 easy health checks you can run

0. What stars do my stocks get
0. Does Wall Street think there is short term upside, or could it fall
0. Does Wall Street think the shares are a Buy, Sell or Hold
0. What is the long-term growth potential for my stocks
 
#### Stars

It's easy to eyeball the stocks in your portfolio. If any are 2 or less stars, you should reconsider then.

#### Short term

Wall Street research analysts publish a target price for every stock they write about. We look at the average price target. If Wall Street thinks one of your stocks could go down, then it's time to reconsider the investment.

#### Buy, Sell, Hold

Wall Street also publishes its views on the shares. This information is for the big asset management firms, but we have access to the average recommendation of Wall Street. Any of your stocks that are rated  Hold, Sell, or Strong Sell, merit a check. 

Wall Street is often wrong. But they could have legitimate reasons to hate a stock you own.

#### Long-term potential

Finally, at the bottom of the page we have your portfolio and it's projected growth. We combine, Wall Street's long-term growth forecast, Wall Street's forecast for dividends and PE forecasts to calculate a projected return for each stock. 

This calculation is a normalisation of the forecast data of Wall Street. Highly rated stocks, revert to trend. Low growth stocks, revert to trend. We ignore price targets and recommendations and focus on the numbers.

If any of your stocks are projected to grow at less than 8%, the long-term return of the US stock market, it is worth revisiting why you own it.

Note: if there isn't sufficient data from Wall Street, we use a placeholder return on 8%, in line with the long-term return of the US stock market for the last 140 years.

### Part 3. Taking action

Once you've identified some stocks that could be "unwell", what do you do next?

Nothing. You do not trade immediately. It's time to check if the stock is a potential "bad-egg". 

* Revisit the logic behind you buying the stock in the first place.
* Think again, if I didn't own this today, would I be buying it?
* Look at our analysis for the company
* Check out a competitor, to see if there any better
* And as a last resort, use Find Ideas page to search for a new stock idea

### Conclusion

Getting a health check is pretty easy. All the data is on the Watchlist page. It's really quick to spot any potential bad-eggs. And if you do, Stockflare is the place to pick some new stocks.
